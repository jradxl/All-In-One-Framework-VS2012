#All In One Framework VS2012

----------  

Microsoft's examples from the All In One Framework, but for VS2012 and .Net 4.5  
http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/

I have not upgraded "source.extension.vsixmanifest", and this will open in the XML Editor.
There is also no VSIX Project Property page, but the examples are set to start Experimental Instance on F5.

1. VSSDK IDE Sample Running Document Table (RDT) Event Explorer.  
   TODO: The Icons for the Tool Window are not correct

2. VSSDK IDE Sample Options Page

3. Basic Source Control Provider
